    "Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers, including variable names, function names, and class names. This means that an identifier named \"example\" is different from an identifier named \"Example\" or \"EXAMPLE\". It is a good practice to use lowercase letters and separate words in an identifier using underscores (e.g., \"example_identifier\").\n",
