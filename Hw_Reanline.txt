Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It operates by maintaining a set of nodes whose distances from the source node have been finalized. Initially, the distance of the source node is set to 0, and all other nodes are set to infinity.
